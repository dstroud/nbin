# nbin

Another `nb`-related norns mod.

This one allows you to play nb synths with an external midi controller or sequencer while using some other script. Play along with your n.kria, for example.

Allows polyphonic pitch bend and pressure modulation, for voices that support it. Tested with Linnstrument in MPE mode and Emplaitress, which now supports polyphonic expression too.
